This repository is designed to provide a lean and abstract plinth atop PyTorch
Lightning, with which models can be quickly trained and tested. It contains 
basic deep learning models, and routines for data loading, data processing, model
training, model testing, and finetuning. 

It should mainly serve as a mixin, as a git submodule of other projects, to speed
up development time.
